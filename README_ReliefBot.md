In order to run this successfully:

1. Run `pip install py4j`
2. Install Java 8
3. Place ReliefBot.py in the RLBot directory
4. Double click on ReliefBot.jar (jar can be located in any directory)
5. Run runner.py




Advanced:

- It is also fine to run ReliefBot.jar after runner.py, and even close and restart it while runner.py is active.
- You can also run on the command line with `java -jar ReliefBot.jar` to see stack traces for debugging purposes.
- If there is a port conflict, you can create a file called `port.txt` with a single number in it to override the port used. The file must be in the same directory as both ReliefBot.jar and ReliefBot.py.
